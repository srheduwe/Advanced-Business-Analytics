# Advanced-Business-Analytics
Final Project of ABA in cooperation with other students

In this project, my fellow students and I investigated on a dataset with Google reviews. Our goal was to extract the maximum amount of possible information about the users to demonstrate, how much data one shares by writing reviews without thinking about it. It uses mainly techniques of the field of NLP.
